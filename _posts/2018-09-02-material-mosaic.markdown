**Material Mosaic** is a grid-system second-hand material organizer facilitating the architecture faculty students to reuse materials in a comfortable and playful manner. With minimal open bar compartments and white isometric background frame, it facilitates students to easily discover gems and share their materials that can still do good for others. As materials with heterogeneous textures and shapes crisscross, a collective mosaic collage is formulated, from which the name of the project originated from.

### Context
<!-- &nbsp; -->

The architecture faculty of TU Delft is notorious for the amount of waste it produced. At the end of every semester, waste material is collected in a truck-sized container outside of the building. This problem triggered the question: *What can design do to change the material waste problem occurring in the architecture faculty of TU Delft?*

###### *Being in an anxious and stressful context, students were avoiding material uncertainty as much as possible!*

95% of the students were not reusing the materials due to following reasons.
<ul>
  <li>Current reuse bins’ poor usability: The bins were usually placed hidden in the corner and outnumbered by trash cans, creating the affordance of guilty purchase and dumping of materials. </li>
  <li>Current reuse bins’ ergonomic hazards: The bins were built either too low or too high. So people had to bend over or stand on their toes to rummage through the materials as if they are trash, making them feel embarrassed.</li>
  <li>The Modelling Hall’s stressful context: Students were mostly cramming at the last minute when they were building physical models. ‘Better be sure’ was their motto in terms of material supply, avoiding uncertainty as much as they can by simply buying and hoarding the materials.</li>
</ul>

Generative contextmapping sessions disclosed following design opportunities.
<ul>
  <li>***Pickers become putters:*** 90% of **‘pickers’** - students who benefited from the reuse bins - came back to the bins regularly and they afterward became ‘putters’ themselves, putting their left-over materials into the bins.</li>
  <li>***Reuse bins’ creative & social potentials:*** Students associated them with concepts like ‘art’, ‘togetherness’, ‘meeting point’, and ‘curiosity’.</li>
</ul>
