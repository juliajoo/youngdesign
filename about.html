<p>Annyeong (Hello in Korean) ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>Iâ€™m Jooyoung, a UX researcher and designer from South Korea, based in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Born and raised in Seoul where the latest technologies are rapidly embraced into everyday human lives, I felt the need to explore methods and technologies of creating user-centric interfaces and experience. Holding a flexible yet critical attitude to technologies, I am interested in involving actual users into the design process.</p>
<p>How are technologies transforming human lives and behaviors from a very individual level to societal, and political level? What can designers do to improve peopleâ€™s lives? And how can we design products or service systems embracing different individualsâ€™ lives and promoting their sustainable well-being?</p>
<p>Using my interdisciplinary background ranging from Pedagogy, Information Science to Industrial Design Engineering, I carry out thorough research on usersâ€™ context, utilizing qualitative or quantitative user research methodologies and design thinking approach. I often facilitate collaborative design sessions like contextmapping and co-creation workshops to fully understand target contexts and incorporate diverse stakeholdersâ€™ interests. I conceptualize products, service systems and design physical/digital/hybrid interactive experiences, using graphic design, codes, and rapid prototyping skills.</p>
